                <p>GrETEL is free for students and academic research, but the corpora that are accessible via GrETEL
                    are
                    <strong>not meant for distribution</strong>. In other words, we do not have the rights to give
                    out
                    the
                    corpus as a whole.
                    If a user would search for a structure with only a
                    <code>cat="top"</code> node, they could literally download the whole corpus - which is not the
                    intention
                    of this project. If you would
                    like to obtain the raw corpus data (for academic or commercial use), you should contact the

                <p>GrETEL is designed as a corpus query tool which means that it is useful for anyone who is
                    interested
                    in
                    searching
                    through the Lassy Small, CGN, or SoNaR treebanks. The tool is especially useful if you want to
                    look
                    for
                    <em>specific linguistic patterns</em> in those corpora.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Why does XPath generated for SoNaR only have one leading slash, when the code for
                LASSY
                and
                CGN has two?
            </h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>It has to do with how XPath structures work on the one hand, and how we optimised the SoNaR
                    database
                    on
                    the other.
                    An XPath pattern that begins with a double slash makes sure that the pattern is searched for in
                    all
                    descendants
                    of the current node (or implied root), whereas a single slash restricts the search to its direct
                    children. How
                    that difference is relevant for SoNaR has been described in the paper cited below.</p>

                <p>In addition to an overall design update, major changes include a more intuitive query builder in
                    the
                    example-based
                    search mode and a visualizer for syntax trees that is compatible with all modern browsers.
                    Moreover,
                    the
                    results
                    are presented as soon as they are found, so you can browse the matching sentences before the

                    search
                    is completed. Furthermore it is possible to query the 500-million word SoNaR treebank in a
                    similar
                    fashion as
                    the two one-million word treebanks CGN and LASSY Small.</p>

                <p>A rewrite of the user interface. Links to results can now be shared and navigation is more
                    flexible,
                    quicker and more reliable.
                    The entry of XPATH has been updated with a highlighted editor, performing live validation and
                    showing
                    suggestions.
                    It's also possible now to show the context of a search (the preceding and following sentence)
                    for an
                    XPATH-based
                    search. We've also added an application for uploading new corpora. Furthermore filtering has
                    been
                    added
                    to be
                    able to filter results by metadata. Finally a completely new analysis module has been added
                    allowing
                    the
                    properties

                <p>
                    A user searches for

                    <code>$node1 = //node</code> and
                    <code>$node2 = $node1[node]</code>. A sentence with the following structure would match this
                    query:
                </p>
                <pre>node[np] (node[det] node[noun])</pre>
                <p>The node found for

                    <code>$node2</code> will then be

                    more
                    specific structure, this is unlikely
